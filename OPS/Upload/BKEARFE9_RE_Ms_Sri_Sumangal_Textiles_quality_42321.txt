Dear Rohit,

Ref. : Sort No. 42321 Peach (20’s Cotton x 220 den Poly/Lycra ; Dobby)_RFD fabric supplied to M/s. Sri 
Sumangal Textiles, New Delhi.

Please find attached herewith the NITRA Analysis report for the white(undyed) specks found in the 
Trouser sample- as collected from the customer end during our visit on 28th October. As per NITRA 
Analysis Report – the white specks on fabric face side are appearing due to white (undyed polyester 
filament) coming out on the fabric after Peaching operation.

Also as per our analysis as well, we had the similar observation about the said problem.

Remarks : 1) The fabric – in the older supplies as well, was showing similar observation although it was 
very less in intensity. We have the opinion that the Peaching in case of certain Dobby Weave 
Construction fabrics should be avoided or should be kept lighter.
2) The defective garments - as shown & informed to us that these were being sold at some discounted 
price by the customer , suitable commercial call may be taken to resolve the issue.

Dear Rohit,

Just talked to the customer (Mr. Ashish) & explained him the below said fact that polyester 
part(undyed) of weft yarn is getting reflected at certain places on the face side of the fabric (which is 
only cotton part dyed).

As per customer feedback – they understand that this neppy/white specks issue might be due to the 
polyester (undyed/white) reflection but they have not faced such issue in the earlier (6-8 months 
older) supplies.

Hence we need older POs details to fetch the fabric and to get it dyed in-house (on lab trial basis) to 
conclude further in this matter.

Subject: FW: sri sumangal textiles quality 42321

Dear Rohit , 

Ref. Sort No. SCP 42321  ( 20’s Cotton * 220D PF Lycra ;  Dobby)
Customer : M/s. Shri Sumangal  Textiles , New Delhi 
PO No. – RMG/000399/2016 & RMG/001524/2016
Issue :  Neps issue 

The said fabric has been supplied as RFD fabric with peach finish.
Further the customer has done garment over dyeing followed by some softner/enzyme washing.

In the received cotton (one) part dyed garment from customer end ,  white specks / dots are visible in 
the
fabric (being referred as Neps by the customer) , but actually these are not neps. After analysis , we 
have 
found that these tiny white dot type specks in the (only) cotton part dyed garment are weft 
white(undyed part)
Polyester fibres, in actual. And this type of effect is bound to come in this type of fabric construction 
and single 
part dyed fabric. 



Regards,
VK Sharma
