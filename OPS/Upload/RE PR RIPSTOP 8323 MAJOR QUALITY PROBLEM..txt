Dear Sir,

Ref. : M/s. P&R_EXP/22436/2014_8323_Black_Teflon Finished.

We have checked the inspection record & found that all the goods have been 
packed in A-class. No Streakiness/color coming off from the fabric was 
observed.

And the shipment sample sent to the customer is of the same lot that has been 
dispatched in bulk.The shipment sample was approved by the customer and then 
only the goods were delivered  .

However today when we observed the grouping strips & shade folder, we observed 
that the strips are extremely patchy. On discussion with the Processing team & 
Chemical suppliers it was understood that these special finishes(Teflon in 
this case) are done at a high temperature, the fabric needs to be allowed 
sufficient time to cool down before packing.This is to avoid dye hydrolysis 
during transportation.Else It can happen in case the container has been 
fumigated recently or is damp.
 
During transportation the fabric is subject to high temperatures and this 
assists in dye hydrolysis. The same experiment was repeated at our end and the 
results were confirmed.

It would help us if we get the sample from the buyer so that we can sent it 
for testing at the supplier end . This will help us in getting to the root 
cause.

Best Regards,
Arwinder Singh.

Arun ,
 I have been speaking to Malcolm on an quality problem on the 8323.
 PO 6111 
Placed on 12-02-13 for 2,000 mts.
 The shipment sample came in and was Rejected because of Streakiness.
 A new sample was sent and Approved, bulk was delivered to Bulgaria and cut 
with no problem.
PO 6231
 Placed on 25-06-13 for 2,000 mts.
 The shipment sample was sent and Approved.
 Bulk as been delivered to Bulgaria and  totally REJECTED for Streakiness plus 
colour coming off the fabric.
 These goods, 1,700 mts. have been loaded on to a truck and are on there way 
back to the UK.
 Malcolm has a major problem as he needs to make garments , and cannot use 
this fabric.
 I am going in to look at this with Malcolm Monday 17 Feb as he is away next 
week.
His thoughts are as follows:
The fabric from PO 6111 which were rejected, have been sent for PO 6231  as it 
is the same problem .
 This is a MAJOR ISSUE , you need to investigate and some how get fabric for 
Malcolm Urgently.
 We have a new order in place PO 6373 can we have this made on Quick response 
or can you find a replacement lot quickly.
 Plus find out why such rejected fabric every left JCT's Factory.
 I await your reply .
 Regards Alan.
